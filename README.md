# Fractals

This is a collection of fractal visualizations written in Python and JavaScript. Each one is a self-contained example of recursive geometry, built for speed, simplicity, and visual clarity.

> These aren't just code demos — they're algorithms that turn logic into art.

## Included Fractals

| Fractal            | Language  | Description                              |
|--------------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| **Dragon Curve**   | Python + Turtle | Classic self-similar curve with 90° folds |
| **Koch Snowflake** | Python + Turtle | Triangle-based fractal with recursive edges |
| **Levy C Curve**   | Python + Turtle | Fractal with a zig-zag 45° pattern       |
| **Mandelbrot Set** | Python + NumPy + Matplotlib | Complex-plane visualization with color mapping |
| **Fractal Tree**   | JavaScript + p5.js | Interactive recursive binary tree with adjustable angle |

## Turtle Fractals

These use Python's built-in Turtle module.

## MatPlotLib Fractals

Make sure you have MatPlotLib and NumPy installed using pip.

pip install matplotlib numpy

## JavaScript Fractals

Run by opening index.html in your web browser.

Use the slider at the bottom to change the branch angle in real-time.
